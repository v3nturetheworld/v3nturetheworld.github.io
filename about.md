I'm a Sophmore Computer Science student at the University of Denver in Denver, CO. I am interested in Machine Learning, specifically Deep Learning, and it's potential uses. I enjoy Science, particularly Physics, and seeing ways where Computer Science and Natural Sciences can help eachother progress. 

In my free time I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking, and skiing. I love exploring new places and traveling.
